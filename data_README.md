# CATNIP Derivatives Dataset

This dataset contains the derivatives generated by the [CATNIP](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/CATNIP) pipeline from the publication [Bakalar et al., 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.04.532985v1).

## Root Directory Subject Data are Deconvovled and N4 corrected Image Stacks

The images in the subject subdirectories are NOT the raw images from the lightsheet microscope. They are the images after the orignal 3D image stacks were deconvolved via Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm with 20 iterations using a theoretical PSF, downsampled to 25 micron isotropic voxels via cubic b-spline interpolation and corrected for any intensity inhomogeneity using N4. These images are the first step in the CATNIP pipeline.

## Derivatives

The derivatives from downstream steps of the CATNIP pipeline of the deconvolved and N4 corrected image stacks are stored in the `derivatives` directory.
